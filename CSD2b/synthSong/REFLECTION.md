# REFLECTION CSD2B: OOP, C++, and Reflections

## Starting From Zero

Back in middle school I would have tests, and study for 1-2 days before the test to get a decent grade. I didn’t worry about homework at all and that’s why I a lot of the subjects didn’t stick with me, I used to do it only for the test.  
This period on the other hand was so much more different than this. I started procrastinating pretty much everything with CSD, but the wise part in me really wanted to get to know the basics of C++ before helplessly doing something with it, and this came in the form of reflecting on everything. As small preparation before getting to the exercises, I looked through almost all the tabs in w3schools on C++, and played with the example code.  
When starting the exercises, I really liked reflecting on all the steps I took to analyse and write the code. It’s such an easy way of efficiently processing information, just writing it down.  
This is why I started adding ReadMe’s to exercise-files this period. I have included them also in the **Assignment Reflections**, obviously with added labels to what exercises they belong.  
Overall, this helped me move towards my goal, not just looking forward and taking steps, but also taking previous steps with me along the way.

## Reflecting on OOP

It was very nice to have a visual image to start with (class diagram). It was very hard for me to find my way through it, but i started (literally) connecting things in my head once I was coding with the class diagram as reference.  
It was also refreshing to have multiple files to work with and headers and such. I can easily see that, once you make it your own, it's so powerful to navigate it.  

## Small Reflecting on Writing Reflections

I really liked this form of reflecting. It expanded on the GitHub workflow in this way:
- With commits, the work is divided in steps, like tasks that need to be done
- What I did per reflection, was taking small steps within each task, writing down my thoughts as in a journal and clearing my head.

## Learning Goal 1: Planning

Went horrible pretty much. First 3 weeks i didn't do much because i was scared of the new way of compiling, i didn't understand build files and CMakeLists etc etc.  
But got much better. Last few days i've been on fire with coding and learning things but i still have much to do. I partially can't finish my code now because of my trip to South-Africa, but of course that's not an excuse.  
I did notice it got better when i started asking questions and talking to people, which brings me to:

## Learning Goal 2: Asking Questions

I did need a lot of help to get on the right track, and i did find it eventually by asking questions. Around 5 times, I sent the CSD group chat all sorts of questions about error messages and how things worked in general.  
I did lots of googling error messages and syntax.  
And also the lessons really helped, asking Ciska and Daan questions about how things worked gave me motivation to pursue it more than the first few weeks.

## Completion

I really want to complete it, but i think that will be at the presentation in January...
Things to complete:
 - Sound doesn't work anymore for some reason, so now i have just gone with the Synth setup (2 custom oscillators together), and not RM or FM. The code that doesn't work is in comments
 - FM calculation
 - Unique things about RM and FM
 - User choice for FM/RM working

## Takeaways

1. START EARLIER
This also means being present and active in the lessons, talking to others and asking questions because it helps with motivation and knowledge.

2. LEARN SYNTAX
While coding and trying things for myself, I kept running into issues that i couldn't fix because i wasn't familiar with the syntax. So, maybe spent more time on syntax before actually coding.

3. REFLECTING
Reflecting is good and healthy, definitely in a design- and production-process. I had a positive experience with writing reflection journals, so i'll keep doing that.  

4. PLAN MY TRIPS (:
Maybe it's not a good idea to go to South-Africa on the day of the deadline, I can see that now...

## FINAL REFLECTION: THE CODE WORKSSSS

I noticed that i had something in comments that shouln't have been, so the sound works now!! I added RM. And now FM as well! and even user choice for this. Helemaal mooi
