# Experience of this assignment
I am learning a lot by doing this assignment and i think it is important to reflect on it.  
I did not use copy/paste at all during this, so by repetition i learned a lot about syntax and how classes work. Also, using terms like constructor, methods and members is normal now.  
I did lots of testing regarding using multiple files. At first it was hard because i thought it was very chaotic.  
Right now i have finished both the dog and the cat. It was very nice to repeat the process of the dog again.  
I didn't look at the ciska-code anymore, only my own code sometimes as example.
