# Focus
The focus of my choice is the Plugin Focus.  
I really liked the controller-focus as well, but i thought i'd focus on the more production side of the coin. Since my other main subject is PROD, I'm making something fun I know I'm actually going to use in the future.  

# Plugin Idea
When producing, I often use synthesizers in the background for texture and atmosphere, especially in combination with reverb. Tweaking every knob of every plugin in the chain of the synth is often a long process, so this "one-knob" assignment would actually help me out here. It'll be a fun little plugin to throw on my synths and see what sounds nice with just one sweep.

# Effects
The effects that are gonna be included in the knob are (in order of the chain):
- Phaser (difficulty 3)
- Waveshaper without wavetable (difficulty 1)
- Plate reverb (difficulty 4)

## Reason for these Effects
Pretty simple reason for this actually: When making synths and doing some sound design, i often just throw some of these on and tweak them until i think it sounds nice, and process them in some way. So the product of this assignment would be: A personal quick macro to throw some effects on a synth :).  

## Extra Maybe?
If i have more time or need a challenge I want to look into Room Reverb, and maybe add a Tape Delay. Just because i think it would fit the synth-preset well. I am keeping this in mind, as one of my learning goals is not overworking my own capacity. So, first the 3 main effects, maybe later make it more cool.

# Mapping
See **Mapping.png** for a visual.  
The Waveshaper and Reverb cross-fade into each other when the knob is turned from 0-1.  
The phaser wet/dry has 0% when knob = 0 or 1, and 100% when knob = 0.5.  

## Reason for this Mapping
I am really motivated to do something with reverb because i absolutely love reverb.
What i don't like is 100% reverb combined with 100% distortion, so that's where the idea came from to be able to find a nice balance between these.  
The phaser was basically just another fun parameter i could add to the synth-preset, for me it's basically to make the sound more "background-texture-vibe".  

## Possible Other Mapping
I do want to entertain the idea of making more mappings based on the different parameters in the 3 effects, like different shapes in the waveshaper, or phaser things like frequency and feedback amount.  
That'll be just another thing i could fool around with if i have the set basic effects i want to use with wet/dry ratio.
