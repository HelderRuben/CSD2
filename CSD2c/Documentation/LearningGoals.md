# Takeaways from last time
Before moving on to the learning goals, I want to process the takeways from last block. I guess this would be part of the overall reflection, before even beginning the assignment, for good preparation in mindset.  
This is what i wrote at the end last time:

> Takeaways
> 1. START EARLIER
This also means being present and active in the lessons, talking to others and asking questions because it helps with motivation and knowledge.
> 2. LEARN SYNTAX
While coding and trying things for myself, I kept running into issues that i couldn't fix because i wasn't familiar with the syntax. So, maybe spent more time on syntax before actually coding.
> 3. REFLECTING
Reflecting is good and healthy, definitely in a design- and production-process. I had a positive experience with writing reflection journals, so i'll keep doing that.  
> 4. PLAN MY TRIPS (:
Maybe it's not a good idea to go to South-Africa on the day of the deadline, I can see that now...

## Briefly reflecting on this:
1. I am starting a BIT earlier than last time, but not in the ideal conditions... I want to try my best to keep things moving and spread out the workload over the weeks that are left.  
2. I'm writing this before I code anything very serious, but i want to be very conscious of what i'm coding, so i'm probably gonna revisit last block a lot, just looking at how i did it there and how things work. Broadly, of course i know how things work but because last time was such a quick deadline-rush, i don't fully embody the knowledge now.  
3. Starting a journal on every assignment, still gonna be doing this!
4. Kind of ironic, but i did plan another trip :). I'm happy its not in the deadline but in the roostervrije week, but still i need to work around it. Currently i am working hard to make up for the time i can't spend in that week, and after the trip i'll do the same. This period i'm making the decision to step back from a lot of free-time-activities. This can be pretty hard for me sometimes, but i fortunately really enjoy working on this subject as well.

# Learning Goals This Time
Okayy, I covered some things above already but these are the learning goals I'm picking:

1. "De CSD’er kan een haalbare planning aanhouden met zelfstudietijd evenredig verspreid over de weken en kan hiermee een (ongezonde) eindsprint voorkomen."
- Because of my small "false start" again and my trip (also again), I want to be able to make the most of my time and spread out the workload. The past may seem to repeat itself here, but it's gonna be less of a mess than last time!
2. "De CSD’er kan het beoogde ontwerp afstellen op de eigen capaciteit, zowel het afbakenen ter voorkoming van overbelasting als het opschalen ter voorkoming van onderbelasting."
- Ik heb nog wel eens de neiging om te veel te willen doen met dit soort projecten. Het in stand houden van het leerdoel "stapsgewijs werken" komt hier ook om de hoek kijken.
